# CustomQueue

CustomQueue is an experimental C# library that implements a custom queue collection, similar to the built-in `Queue<T>`, designed for extending queue behaviors with custom logic. This library focuses particularly on enabling custom dequeue behavior, making it useful for scenarios where specialized queue processing is required.
